## Masters Research
My research is focused on applying statistical learning techniques to gene expression data collected from *Mycobacterium Tuberculosis*, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. While not a serious health concern in many 1st world countries, tuberculosis is still the number one most deadly pathogenic bacteria in the world. Additionally, antibiotic resistance in *M. tuberculosis* is a growing concern within the health community. With new statistical learning techniques, my research better allows us to understand how *M. tuberculosis* responds to its enviroment, which helps us better combat the pervasiveness of the disease.
