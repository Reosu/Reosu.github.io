Hi! My name is Reo Yoo, and thank you for checking out my website. This page is where I get to talk about the places I've been and the things I like to do.

## Where I'm From

I was born in Singapore but moved to the States when I was quite young. I've been living in San Diego for the last 15 years, so if you ever need a recomendation for the best beaches or best burritos while your here, shoot me a message!

## Education

I'm proudly a Triton from University of California, San Diego! I graduated with a BS in Bioengineering in 2020, and then joined the BS/MS program in the same department. I recieved my Masters in Bioengineering in 2021, focusing my research and my thesis on Bioinformatics analysis on M. tuberculosis.

## Hobbies

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and outdoors. Running, work-outs, hiking, and camping are always on the list of to-do's, and I am always looking for new places to explore.

At home, I enjoy playing the guitar and cooking. You can check out the dishes I make with my girlfriend on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beanandboifoodadventures/)
